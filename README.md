Instructions:
- run init.m
- mex trust_n_agents.c

The uploading of .slx files without corupting them was successful and without any problems.
rander.m should be ran first and the code works for the inputs up to 8.
new_plot.m plots 8 mussels and up to 8 fish in two dimensional space, movement paterns for fish are created by running the musule.slx.

6.6.2016.
Run rander.m for 4 agents, final.slx should work for at least 20s simulation time. 
trust_plot_4.m is used in order to plot the zeta and c matrices.
